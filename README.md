## How It Works

The M10PS Cancer Detection system operates through a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that analyzes crucial cellular characteristics. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Input**: Users input specific measurements related to cell nuclei, including both mean and worst-case scenarios for various features.
  
2. **Feature Analysis**: The algorithm examines the following cellular characteristics:
   - **Mean Measurements**: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
   - **Standard Error Measurements**: Evaluating the variability of these features.
   - **Worst Measurements**: Assessing the most concerning values for each feature.
  
3. **Risk Assessment**: Based on the analyzed data, the system calculates the likelihood of malignancy and provides a risk assessment report.

4. **User Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback with recommendations for further action if necessary.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/m10ps-cancer-detection.git

## Usage

To effectively utilize the M10PS Cancer Detection application, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Application**:
